    <h2>Kuku Choma</h2>
    <p>Kuku choma is an East African delicacy comprising marinated chicken pieces, which are then grilled using an oven, electric, or charcoal grill. Just like nyama choma, kuku choma is one of those dishes you can expect to find whenever there is a special gathering of some sort; a football match, engagement parties, weddings, or a simple meetup with friends over the weekend.</p>
